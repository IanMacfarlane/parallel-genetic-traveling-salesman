\maketitle

You can run my code using:\\
mpicc hw8.c -o hw8 -lm\\
mpiexec -np 2 ./hw8\\
My implementation should run for any number of processors.
Though if you only give it 1 processor it won't start running the algorithm because there are no slaves.\\
If you want to run my sequential version just replace hw8 in the above commands with sequential.\\
I implemented my traveling salesperson algorithm using a parallel genetic algorithm.
I initially implemented the genetic algorithm in sequence, which is in sequential.c
This sequential version is actually a lot faster than my parallel implementation.
I'm pretty sure that this is mostly because I am using c and all my array operations are super slow.
For my parallel implementation, as processors increase my genetic algorithm increases its global population.
So that each process no matter how many processes is always dealing with the same size sub population.\\
